Welcome to the software repository of the "Eyes of Things" platform. Eyes of Things is an international project focused on building an open embedded computer vision platform. See more information about EoT in the [website](http://eyesofthings.eu/?page_id=228).  

After more than a year of development we are gradually migrating to this public repository. Expect more software in the upcoming weeks. We are doing likewise with the hardware boards.  

The repository is essentially organized according to platform. 'Myriad' is the platform used by EoT. There are also folders for Android and desktop platforms. For more information consult the [software wiki](https://github.com/EyesOfThings/Software/wiki)

We encourage you to contribute (e.g. new features, bug fixes, a great idea, etc.) to the project. All contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated!
