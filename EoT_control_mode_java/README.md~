###Configuring IDE

In order to configure an IDE for help with the development and compiling process you need import those folders:

* **EoT_MQTT**: this folder contains the user interface of the program.
* **images**: this folder contains the images used by the user interface.
* **paho**: placed on ../../libs. This folder contains the mqtt library used on this app.
