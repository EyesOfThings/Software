# zlib 1.2.8 (adapted to Myriad 2)

zlib 1.2.8 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code is
thread safe.  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs
(Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1950 (zlib format), rfc1951 (deflate format) and
rfc1952 (gzip format).

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file zlib.h .

The zlib home page is http://zlib.net/ .  Before reporting a problem, please check this site.

PLEASE read the zlib FAQ http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html.

## Acknowledgments:

  The deflate format used by zlib was defined by Phil Katz.  The deflate and
  zlib specifications were written by L.  Peter Deutsch.  Thanks to all the
  people who reported problems and suggested various improvements in zlib; they
  are too numerous to cite here.
