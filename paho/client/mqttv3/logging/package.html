Provides facilities to write and format log and trace to help debug problems.

<p>The default log and trace facility uses Java's build in log facility:-
java.util.logging.  For systems where this is not available or where
an alternative logging framework is required the logging facility can be 
replaced using {@link paho.client.mqttv3.logging.LoggerFactory#setLogger(String)}
which takes an implementation of the {@link paho.client.mqttv3.logging.Logger}
interface.

<p>A sample java.util.logging properties file - jsr47min.properties is provided that demonstrates
how to run with a memory based trace facility that runs with minimal performance 
overhead. The memory buffer can be dumped when a log/trace record is written matching 
the MemoryHandlers trigger level or when the push method is invoked on the MemoryHandler. 
{@link paho.client.mqttv3.util.Debug Debug} provides method to make it easy
to dump the memory buffer as well as other useful debug info.
