# libccv 0.7 (adapted to Myriad 2)

libccv is a minimalist computer vision library developed by Liu Liu. It is meant to be easy to deploy and had simple organized code with a bit caution with dependency hygiene.

Its main characteristics are:

- It is portable and embeddable.
- It includes several modern computer vision algorithms.
- It has a clean interface with cached image preprocessing.

##### Depencences

- zlib.
- cblas.
- libpng.

##### Known limitations of the port (which works in the original libccv)

- jpeg is not supported (libjpeg would be needed to be compiled).
- Reading/writing sqlite3 files is not supported. This feature could be used in read/write methods of:
	- ccv_scd
	- ccv_convnet
